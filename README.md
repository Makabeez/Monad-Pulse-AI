# 🧠 Monad Pulse v1.0

**Monad Pulse** is an autonomous AI agent designed for high-frequency liquidity management, specifically optimized for the **Monad** ecosystem.

## 🏁 Submission Eligibility Check
- **Verified Contract (Monad Testnet):** `0x860368940C29f939e09968478441991A570db3fd`
- **Documentation:** Full transparency with `PRD.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- **Proof of Work:** Real-time on-chain execution loop (Block 10274434)

## 🚀 Project Vision
Our goal is to demonstrate how AI agents can leverage Monad's **parallel execution** and ultra-high throughput to perform large-scale transactions with zero human intervention.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture
- **Smart Contract (Solidity):** An intelligent vault managing agent authorizations and strategy execution.
- **AI Agent Engine (Ethers.js):** An autonomous decision loop simulating market analysis and triggering on-chain signals every 30s.
- **Frontend Dashboard:** A real-time interface to monitor agent status and transaction flows.

## 📊 Execution Proof (Testnet)
- **Burner Wallet:** `0x1BcE0D52081B68B81e84193b5644AF8B9A552d19`
- **Network:** Monad Testnet (Chain ID 10143)

## 💡 Innovation & Originality
- **Custom AI Loop:** The core logic in `scripts/agent_pulse.js` is original work designed to test Monad’s parallel transaction limits.
- **Architecture:** Custom implementation of the `triggerPulse` function specifically to leverage Monad's sub-second finality.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap
1. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Integration:** Enabling our sentinel to receive signals from external AI Risk Management agents.
2. **Parallel Scaling:** Expanding the agent's capacity to manage multiple pools in parallel.
